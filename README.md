** Techniques I used **

Clean Data:
I cleaned the data I searched for duplicate rows using the Remove Duplicates feature but there were no duplicates I removed empty values from the rows and deleted columns that I thought I wouldn't use I corrected the text and removed extra spaces I split one column into multiple columns whether it was text or numbers.
Some questions I asked for analysis:
-  How many movies which produced every year?
-  Top ten movies with the most votes and least votes? 
-  Top ten movies with the highest ratings?
-  Top ten movies with the highest profits?
-  How many movies are in each genre?
-  Which genres have made the most profits?
-  Which countries produce the most movies?
-  Which languages have the most movies produced?
-  Which languages have the most movies produced?
-  Which countries have made the most profits from movies?
-  Top ten actors and directors who have made the most profits?
-  
Data analysis:
We will answer these questions by analyzing the data After adding new columns to help with the analysis such as profit and genres, I used a pivot table to analyze it I used sum average and count to get quick summaries like average ratings or the number of movies in each genre.     I also used Excel tools to filter data by category year and profit to get deeper insights.

data visualization:
I used Excel pivot chart to create bar or pie charts to show data like ratings for each movie or production years I also used line charts to compare ratings over time or between different movies.

This dashboard answers the questions.
-  How many movies which produced every year?
-  Top ten movies with the most votes and least votes? 
-  Top ten movies with the highest ratings?
-  Top ten movies with the highest profits?
